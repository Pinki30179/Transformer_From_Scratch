# Transformer Model from Scratch for Text Generation

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Transformer model designed for text generation. It can be trained on a custom text dataset and used to generate new text based on a given input prompt.

## Overview

It uses an attention mechanism to process input sequences in parallel, making it highly efficient for tasks like text generation.

### Key Components:
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the position of words in the sequence.
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Processes the input sequence with the encoder and generates the output sequence with the decoder.
- **Text Generation**: The model can generate text based on a given input using the `generate` method.

## Requirements

To run this code, you'll need:
- Python 3.11 or higher
- PyTorch (1.13.0 or higher)
- NumPy

install the necessary dependencies with:

```bash
pip install torch numpy


## Model Hyperparameters
Here are the key parameters for the model:

- src_vocab_size: The size of the source vocabulary.
- tgt_vocab_size: The size of the target vocabulary.
- d_model: The dimension of the model (embedding size).
- num_heads: The number of attention heads.
- num_layers: The number of encoder and decoder layers.
- d_ff: The dimension of the feed-forward network.
- max_seq_length: The maximum sequence length.
- dropout: The dropout rate.

## Usage
1. Prepare Your Dataset
Place your text data in a file (e.g., input.txt).

2. Train the Model
Use the training loop to train the model on your dataset.

3. Generate Text
Once trained, use the generate method to create new text based on a prompt.
